I am a data scientist at [The Data Lab](thedatalab.com) in Scotland. We are tasked with increasing economic activity in Scotland around data science, see the site for more info. This means we get to work with a bunch of different industries, public sector departments and academics, all with different data and different objectives.

As you can imagine this is a huge amount of fun and leads to the discovery of new methods and new tricks in handling and analysing data. As I move around in this journey, I will post bits and pieces on this page. Sometimes these are things that accompany The Data Lab [blogs](http://thedatalab.com/news). These articles (if written by me) will usually have an accompanying github repo. If so then I might well explain some of that in more detail here.

Feel free to contact me about any of this.

Thanks
:-)
