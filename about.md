I am a data scientist at [The Data Lab](http://thedatalab.com) in Scotland. We are tasked with increasing economic activity in Scotland around data science, see the site for more info. This means we get to work with a bunch of different industries, public sector departments and academics, all with different data and different objectives.

As you can imagine this is a huge amount of fun and leads to the discovery of new methods and new tricks in handling and analysing data. As I move around in this journey, I will post bits and pieces on this page. Sometimes these are things that accompany The Data Lab [blogs](http://thedatalab.com/news). These articles (if written by me) will usually have an accompanying github repo. If so then I might well explain some of that in more detail here.

This site is hosted by github pages and each post is written in R markdown. The source for each post can be found [here](https://github.com/rmnppt/rmnppt.github.io/tree/master/_source). I forward these blogs to [r-bloggers.com](http://r-bloggers.com). If you are an R user, keep your eye on this site for nicely curated blog content relating to R and its uses.

Please feel free to contact me about any of this.

In a former life I did research into bacterial communication and cooperation. If you're interested in reading any of this the best place to start is on [my google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=B8e_XeYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
