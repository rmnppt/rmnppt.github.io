For a while now, I have been looking for ways to incorporate pretty D3 graphics into R generated reports or shiny apps. Ok well I wasn't looking too hard because it completely escaped me that you could do this with [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/). I stumbled upon this when I was browsing the [shiny user showcase](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-user-showcase/) and I came across the [FRISS Analytics example](https://frissdemo.shinyapps.io/FrissDashboard/) which is accompanied by a really [fantastic set of tutorials](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) under 'other tutorials'. If you want to do this to customise for your own plotting needs, I strongly suggest you start there with those tutorials. They are very thourough and step-wise and will allow you to build a R-D3 binding for the first time with very little hassle, as I have done.
